# react-tdd-guide
A series of examples on how to TDD React

## Getting started

1. install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
- Grab an editor or IDE. I recommend Webstorm, Atom, and VIM, in that order.
- `git clone` ...
- `nvm install 4` OR if v4 of node.js is installed, `nvm use`
- `npm i`

## How to use this guide

Each section is broken out into its own folder, starting with [basics](https://github.com/zpratt/react-tdd-guide/tree/master/basics). What you'll find there is the finished example. I am experimenting with using the [commit history](https://github.com/zpratt/react-tdd-guide/commits/master/basics) and comments to drive the guide itself. Feedback on whether this works or not would be appreciated.

Each commit that is suffixed with **"- red"** can be checked out separately to examine the failing test. Each commit that is suffixed with **"- green"** shows how I finally passed the failing assertion.

Looking at the history for each section will show you only the steps needed to drive that part of the application.

## Philosophy

* Avoid the need for runners and browsers
  * Achieved by using jest and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
